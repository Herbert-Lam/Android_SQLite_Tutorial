This is an academic lab assignment of Android mobile application development course.
I spent around 12 hours to complete this lab assignment.

This lab assignment requires me to create a tutorial on Android SQLite that explains the related concepts including defining a schema and CRUD (create, read, update and delete) processes in a database.
A short output video is included in this repository.
The topic of the database is a simple birth weight database. I use two columns, Infant_Name and Infant-Weight, only for the ease of SQLite demonstration.

The following key Android topics are used in the app:
- Creation of own database class which inherits SQLiteOpenHelper class
- CRUD methods with SQL queries
- Singleton database manipulation in two activities
- Dynamic view creation for reading and displaying the records from the database
- Alternative methods (in the comment section) for updating/deleting a record without using SQL query
- Neat UI by using ConstraintLayout
- Intent
